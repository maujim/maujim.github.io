        if doing the above method, would not need the blow-row-flex class 
        could just have every entry be a child of blog-container-flex with nowrap enabled to the number of entries in each row changes as the screen width changes

        however, the website implements a horizontal scrolling section on mobile which I don't like. I would prefer the user to scroll vertically, which also doesn't require any additional work on my part

        I think the format I'm aiming for is similar to what castel.dev/notes implements

        However, the format of the actual blog entries of typical contents is quite nice 
        The blog posts layout on jaycarlson.net is also quite nice, but that requires having a few posts, and also some nice colorful images to go make the entries pop

        That could be something that is done in the future
