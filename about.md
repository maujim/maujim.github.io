I am currently participating in the Computational Neuroscience course at [Neuromatch Academy](https://academy.neuromatch.io/courses).

Previously, I was a software engineer at [Brave Search](https://www.search.brave.com).

Before that, I was a firmware engineer at [Mosaic Manufacturing](https://mosaicmfg.com).

And before that, I studied [Mathematics and Engineering](https://www.queensu.ca/mathstat/mthe) at Queenâ€™s University, specializing in Systems and Robotics.
